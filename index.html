            I fell in love with computer programming when I started to see that my code was running. 
            I loved every moment when I would press run and the code that I have written on my own from scratch
            would run perfectly withouth throwing any errors.
            This is where I learned how to work in a team and on my own. Both aspects are incredibly important to me as an aspiring freelance Web Developer.
